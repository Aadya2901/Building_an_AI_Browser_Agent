# 🚀 Day 20 of 21 Days, 21 Projects Challenge  
📘 **Web Automation on Autopilot – Building an AI Browser Agent** 🌐🤖  

---

## 📌 Project Overview  
Traditional automation tools like Selenium often **break when web pages change their DOM structure**.  
This project built a **GenAI-powered browser agent** that uses reasoning to navigate dynamically — deciding what to click, where to input text, and what data to extract even when the layout shifts.  

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack & Setup  
- **Frameworks/Tools:** Python, Selenium, LangChain, OpenAI GPT models  
- **Techniques:** Agentic AI, LLM reasoning, dynamic web navigation  
- **Automation Scope:** Form filling, page navigation, data scraping, adaptive workflows  

---

## 📊 Key Highlights  
1. **Task Automation** → Automated browsing tasks like form filling, navigation, and data scraping  
2. **LLM Reasoning** → Adapted to page structure changes without hard-coded rules  
3. **Robustness** → Reduced brittleness compared to traditional rule-based automation  
4. **Scalability** → Capable of handling multiple pages and dynamic content autonomously  

---

## 🖼️ Observations & Results  
- LLM-powered agents successfully **adapted to changing page layouts**  
- Reduced need for manual intervention or script updates  
- Achieved **more reliable and intelligent automation** compared to static Selenium scripts  

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways  
- AI browser agents go beyond scripted automation by **combining reasoning with execution**  
- Workflows become **smarter, adaptive, and future-proof**  
- Enables robust automation across diverse websites, even with **dynamic or frequently changing UIs**  

---

## 🔮 Future Work  
- Integrate **multi-agent coordination** for large-scale web tasks  
- Add **error detection and auto-retry mechanisms**  
- Extend to **multi-step workflows** like e-commerce or enterprise portal automation  
- Deploy as a **cloud service** for continuous web monitoring and data extraction
